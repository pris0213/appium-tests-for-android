# Appium Tests for Android

The reason I'm developing this project is because I want to learn how to test mobile apps with Appium. 

Here you'll find a very simple set of tests for the native Calculator app on Android.
These tests are developed in Java, using Appium and TestNG.

## Requirements

## Running your test set

Simply type the following command on your terminal:

```
$ mvn test
```
